* Before Azure accepts a P2S VPN connection, the user has to be authenticated first. There are three authentication types:
- Certificate
- Microsoft Entra ID
- RADIUS and Active Directory Domain Server

Certificate authentication:
- To configure your P2S gateway for certificate authentication, you upload the trusted root certificate public key to the Azure gateway. 
- You can use a root certificate that was generated using an Enterprise solution, or you can generate a self-signed certificate.
- To authenticate, each client that connects must have an installed client certificate that's generated from the trusted root certificate.
- The validation of the client certificate is performed by the VPN gateway and happens during establishment of the P2S VPN connection.

Certificate authentication workflow:
- Enable Certificate authentication on the P2S gateway, along with the additional required settings (client address pool, etc.), and upload the root CA public key information.
- Generate and download VPN client profile configuration files (profile configuration package).
- Install the client certificate on each connecting client computer.
- Configure the VPN client on the client computer using the settings found in the VPN profile configuration package.
- Connect.
