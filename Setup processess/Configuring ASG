Q. What is ASG used for?
A. Using Application Security Groups (ASGs), you can group multiple VMs, even if they are in different subnets, and apply Network Security Group (NSG) rules to the entire group.

Steps to configure ASG:

Task-1: Create ASG
asg--create--rg--name--region--create

Task-2: Attach ASG to VM's
got to vm--networking--NIC--ASG--configure--select ASG--save

NOTE: 
* you need to attach ASG to all the VM's, i.e adding multiple VM's to ASG.
* you need to create 2 different ASG in different subnets and attach vm's to ASG. Ex: v1, v2 to ASG1  & vv1, vv2 to ASG2.

Task-3: attach ASG to NSG: 
Q. which NSG you need to add ASG rule?
A. If v1, v2(ASG1) in SB1(NSG1) wants to communicate with vv1, vv2(ASG2) in SB2(NSG2) then create NSG rule in NSG2
Ex: NSG of SB2--inbound rule--add--source(ASG)--source ASG(ASG1)--port--destination(ASG)--destination ASG(ASG2)--priority-----go through other steps.
