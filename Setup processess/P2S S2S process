Point-to-Site VPN:

Task-1: Create V-Net
	Virtual network--create--rg--vnet name--region--next--next(IP address)--10.0.0.0/16--Subnets(add--subnet purpose(virtual network gateway)--starting address(10.0.1.0/27)--add subnets for other resources like virtual machines, firewall etc)--review & create.
Task-2: Creating virtual network gateway
	Go to virtual network gateway--create--name--rg--gateway type(VPN)--SKU(vpngw1)--virtual network(select)--Public-IP details(create new or select the IP if you have any)--active active mode(disable)--create(It will take some time to create....).
Task-3: Configuring VPN gateway
	Go to virtual network gateway--point-to-site--address pool(172.16.0.0/24)--Tunnel type(IKEv2 and SSTP (SSL))--Authentication type(Azure certificate)--In Root certificates--Name(Give any name)--Public certificate data(Paste the cert content from notepad(only the main body not beginning and ending))--Save--Download VPN client. 
Task-4: Setting VPN client in your machine
	In your machine you'll get a file downloaded--Go to it--Extract--WindowsAmd64--Vp.....Amd64--more info--Run anyway--yes--Now in search bar--Search for VPN settings--Open--Click on it--Connect--Go through steps in it.
Step-5: Connecting to VM
Get private-IP of VM--In your machine--Cmd or git bash terminal--ping <private-IP>--ssh -i /Path/to/.pem username@private-IP.



Site-to-Site VPN:

Task-1: Create V-Net
Task-2: Creating virtual network gateway
Task-3: Create local gateway(represents On-prem gateway details. This will specify Public-IP of On-prem VPN device & the address space of On-prem internal network)
	(EX: You have public-IP of firewall(ON-prem), You put it in local gateway & also put the internal ip range of On-prem).
	Local network gateway--create--rg--region--name--endpoint(public ip of On-prem firewall ip)--Address space(Address space of your lan internal IP address EX: 172.16.16.0/24)--review & create
Task-4: Create Connection(It is the connection between VPN gateway & local network gateway, Ex: IPsec,VNet to VNet, Site to Site, Provide shared keys for authentication)
	Go to gateway you created--connections--add--rg--connection type(Site-to-Site(IPsec))--name--region--next--virtual network gateway--local network gateway--IKE protocol(IKEV2)--create.

Download Configuration: connections--download configuration--device vendor(select the on-prem WAN/LAN vendor if present or select generic samples--device family(device parameter)--firm version(generic-samples-device-parameter)--download).

Configuration on opposite side(sopos firewall):

open firewall--Search for Site-to-Site in networking(first go through LAN, WAN)
add--name--connection type(tunnel interface)--gateway type(initiate the connection)--active on save
encryption--profile(Microsoft azure(IKEV2))--authentication type--pre shared key(for pre-shared key go to azure portal--in connections select your connection--authentication(you can see your pre shared key))--repeat pre shared key
Gateway settings--remote gateway--gateway address(Public-ip of azure gateway)--remote-id type(ip address)--remote-id(public ip of azure gateway)
Local gateway settings--local gateway--listening interface(select ip of your LAN/WAN)--local ID type(ip address)--local id(get the ipv4 gateway ip)--go through remaining options and save
after connection is securely done.
go to networking(here we need to ceate our tunnel interface)--click on interface that you used earlier & click on it or click on the interface that you created(EX: xfrm1(here you need to provide tunnel interface ip address)
Q. How to get it?
A. go to portal--connections--click on connection that you created--download configuration
open that downloaded file--go down and search for tunnel interface(VTI)--search & look for IP address & its subnet--now go back to On-prem settings--give IP & subnet
advanced settings---select Override MSS--give port from downloaded tunnel interface(VTI)--save
Routing--staticroutes--add--destination ip(give ip address space that you put for your VNet)--interface(select the interface that you created earlier)--administrative distance(1)-metrics(1)--save
create rule& policy---------
