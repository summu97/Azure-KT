* use another script or some source that pulls the secrets and pass them as env variables to required file and when the process is done, the
  env variables are automatically removed so that others cant get the secrets.
* Know the language in which the file is written and add few lines or content that will fetch secrets from key vault and pass as env 
  variables to that file.
* pass secrets as env variables in base64 format and get the base64 secrets and decode inside file(as you are working in Kubernetes cluster,
  it is possible to restrict the env variables only to that particular namespace).
