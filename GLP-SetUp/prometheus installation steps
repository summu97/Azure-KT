System Requirements (Minimum Recommended)
Resource    	Minimum	    Recommended (for production)
CPU	          1 vCPU	    2â€“4 vCPUs (depending on scrape targets)
RAM	          2 GB	      4â€“8 GB
Disk        	10 GB	      50â€“100 GB+ (SSD preferred for time-series DB)
OS	Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 7+, Debian, etc.	Any Linux (x86_64/amd64)
ðŸ’¡ Prometheus is CPU- and disk-heavy, especially with high cardinality or many targets. SSDs improve performance drastically.




Default Network Requirements
Service	            Port	Description
Prometheus	        9090	Web UI and API
Node Exporter      	9100	Default node-level metrics
Blackbox Exporter  	9115	Probe HTTP, ICMP, TCP, DNS, etc.
Pushgateway        	9091	For short-lived jobs (push model)
ðŸ“Œ Ensure these ports are open in your VM/network firewall if you're accessing externally or scraping from other nodes.

Copy prometheus.sh to your local and run: sh prometheus.sh
To access: VM-PublicIP:9090
