Create a Grafana Panel: In Grafana, you can create a panel that checks for the running status of these processes.

Go to Grafana Dashboard.

Add a new panel.

Use a Prometheus query to check the status of the processes. For example, use this query:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
process_start_time_seconds{job="process_exporter", name="prometheus"}
This will return the start time of the Prometheus process, and you can use this metric to determine whether the process is up.

In the Display options:

If the value is greater than zero, show "Up" or a green indicator.

If the value is zero, show "Down" or a red indicator.

You can also combine both Prometheus and Node Exporter in the same panel or separate panels.

Alerting for Process Down: If you want to be alerted when a process goes down, you can set up an alert in Grafana.

For example, an alert condition could be set where the metric process_start_time_seconds{job="process_exporter", name="prometheus"} equals 0.

Set up the alert to notify you when this happens.

Example Query for Grafana Panel:
To show whether Prometheus is up or down, use this query:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
process_start_time_seconds{job="process_exporter", name="prometheus"}
To show whether Node Exporter is up or down, use this query:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
process_start_time_seconds{job="process_exporter", name="node_exporter"}
Panel Configuration:
Visualization: Use Stat or Gauge visualization in Grafana.

Thresholds: Set a threshold to visually indicate the status:

Value 0 = Down (red color).

Value >0 = Up (green color).

Final Setup:
Process Exporter running and exposing metrics about Prometheus and Node Exporter.

Prometheus scraping the Process Exporter metrics.

Grafana querying Prometheus and displaying process status using the start time of the process.

Optional: Set alerts in Grafana to notify you when processes are down.
