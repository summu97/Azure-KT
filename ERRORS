ERROR: Cannot execute /bin/bash: Permission denied
If you're getting a permission denied error even after pressing Enter in the Serial Console, it usually means your default shell is broken (like /bin/bash is missing or not executable), and you're locked out of a login shell.

Step-by-step to fix /bin/bash: Permission denied without logging in:
Go to the Azure Portal--Navigate to Virtual Machines--In the left-hand menu of your VM, scroll down to Operations â†’ click Run command--Click on RunShellScript(RUN: chmod +x /bin/bash After RUN: grep yourusername /etc/passwd)
If you see something like then its running fine:
yourusername:x:1001:1001::/home/yourusername:/bin/bash

If the shell is something like '/bin/false' or '/sbin/nologin', run this to fix it: 'usermod -s /bin/bash yourusername'

Restart the VM
---------------------------
If you want to create a new Virtual Machine from disk snapshot then follow below steps:
- Create disk from snapshot.
- Create new VM.
- Swap new disk with backup snapshot disk.
WHY swapping?
Because, when you create a new vm with disk then Azure will remove old users configuration and create VM with new user details.
