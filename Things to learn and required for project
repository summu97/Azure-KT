TASKS:
* You should access SQL only if you are an authenticated AD user. ---- https://youtu.be/4tOpFnR35P0?si=Jxkdfbxf6VfdC8Ns
* Site-to-Site.(Reference: https://www.youtube.com/@rijoskill/videos)(https://youtu.be/cwnxaB4v3J8?si=Dn1ZaIs7jv98jr_h)
* Point-to-Site.(Reference: https://www.youtube.com/@rijoskill/videos)(https://youtu.be/xib3eQhYDQs?si=oXq-Om0ynoL-7XdA)

* Bastion or any alternatives. What is best in terms of cost, flexibility, disaster.
* Backup & disaster recovery for VM's. How much does it cost if used.
* Creating VM using particular Snapshot version.
* Cost factor between backup & Snapshot.

Infra:
============
* VPC(2-subnets(private-subnet-/22(1024 IP's), public-subnet), NSG or ASG(which is best), Route tables, Firewall rules and policies).
* Servers required: Jenkins server(with sonar), Matching server(D2sV3- for .NET), Red hat(b4ms- for Kafka)

============

* Kafka installation & setup(create topic, brokers)- Try to get max info.
* Go through Kafka and Zookeeper concepts.

* SQL server- Public access disables, use private access.
* Login to Azure SQL server using MFA using mssql(SQL server management). https://youtu.be/BTrwHfTC-9A?si=VTho9ggb1xCM7WlV

* Storage account- Container policies(hot, cold, archive- How they can be applied for individual containers).
* Azure file shares- Identity based access.
* Shared key access should be disabled.
* Life cycle management.

* Resource locks for all resources(accidental deletions).
* accessing all services using private access or private endpoints.
* ACR.
* AKS cluster- Ingress installed in it as load balancer.
* Custom policies.
* Microsoft PIN(Privileged Identity Management)

LEAST PREFERENCE:
* Least preference: Dockerfile with windows for SSIS package build.



WORK FLOW OF PROJECT:
Red hat(Kafka) + AKS cluster(File registration pod) + Storage containers
High-end server- based on vcpu's(Matching Engine)


ISSUES:
* Azure SQL Database should have Azure Active Directory Only Authentication enabled ---- https://youtu.be/4tOpFnR35P0?si=Jxkdfbxf6VfdC8Ns
* Storage accounts should prevent shared key access
* This recommendation was automatically configured with default parameters. Make sure to review and customize its values via Environment Settings Security Policy tab. See Additional Information section below.
